---@field DataType 'CUSTOM_MAP' The name of this data type (always "CUSTOM_MAP")

---@field MinHeight? float The height of a pure black pixel in the HeightMap. Other pixels are interpolated. Default: 5.
---@field MaxHeight? float The height of a pure white pixel in the HeightMap. Other pixels are interpolated. Default: 100.
---@field MaterialMask? TEXTURE An RGB texture describing ground texture: red=grass, green=sand, blue=ignored by default or cliff if MaterialMaskUseBlueChannelForCliff=true. Expected as asset ID.
---@field MaterialMaskUseBlueChannelForCliff? boolean Use blue channel of MaterialMask for cliff mask instead of relying on terrain normals. Default: false.
---@field VillagePathList? MAP_VILLAGE_PATH[] List designating entrances of Newcomers, Envoys, and Trader. Positions should not be separated by water.
---@field SpawnList? MAP_SPAWN_INFO[] List of prefabs added to the map when loaded, e.g., resources like berries and rocks.
